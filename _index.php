        <p>The Rube Goldberg Competition is STWing's annual student contest for
          the best creative device following the ideas of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg">Rube Goldberg</a>.
          You and your team will try to build the best contraption
          that can complete a simple task in the craziest and most circuitous
          way possible.</p>

        <p>Rube Goldberg drew cartoons of machines that took far too many steps
          to complete a simple task. Despite their impracticality, many machines
          have been built based on his ideas. For more information on these
          machines, visit the
